* **[MacOSXSystemFontReplacer](./mac-os-x-system-font-replacer)** — a tool to replace your system UI fonts of Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite with any fonts of your choice
* **[pyftfeatfreeze](./pyftfeatfreeze)** — a tool to “freeze” some OpenType features into a font, so small caps, oldstyle numerals or localized forms become available in apps that don’t support OpenType Layout features (such as many office apps)
